Filipino Christmas celebration is colorful, lively, full of traditions, bright and definitely twinkling. One of the most iconic symbol of  Filipino Christmas spirit, is the Christmas lantern or locally known as &#39;parol&#39;. The star-shaped lanterns are displayed hanging outside the house, along the busy streets of the cities and even in provincial towns and small villages. May it be a parol with simple or intricate designs, for Filipinos it is an expression of shared faith and hope. It also symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness and Filipinos&#39; goodwill during Christmas season.

For Filipinos, it is a known belief that parol making and hanging them outside their homes is a representation of the star of Bethlehem that guided the Three Wise Men to the manger of baby Jesus. However, if we&#39;ll look at the history of parol it can be traced back during the Spanish era in the Philippines, when the Spaniards brought Christianity to the islands. Parols were initially used to light the way to church to faithfully attend the 9-day Simbang Gabi or Misas de Aguinaldo, which begin on the 16th of December, a devotion for petition of special favors. After coming home from hearing the mass, instead of putting away the lantern somewhere else, people would hang it outside the house.
